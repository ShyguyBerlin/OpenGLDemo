# Requirements
to get all the packages needed to build the project run the following:
```
(Ubuntu)
$ sudo apt install libglfw3-dev libgl-dev cmake
```

# Build
Optimally you can run any cmake wrapper in your IDE. There is a really nice extension for VSCode that does that for you, with a bit of configuration. Else you can also run the following command:
```
$ figure this out I have no idea
```
